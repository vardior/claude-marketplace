  "context": "While documenting the Permissions Settings page, noticed references to 'inherited permissions' in the role detail panel. The UI shows an 'Inherited' badge on some permissions, and there's a toggle in Workspace Settings for 'Permission inheritance'. This appears to be an Enterprise-only feature but the exact behavior is unclear from the UI code alone.",
  
  "questions": [
    "How does permission inheritance work between parent and child workspaces?",
    "Which plans have inheritance enabled?",
    "Can inheritance be overridden at the child workspace level?",
    "How is inheritance displayed in the UI (badges, tooltips)?",
    "What happens when a parent workspace permission is removed?"
  ],
  
  "investigate": [
    "src/hooks/usePermissions.ts",
    "src/components/PermissionBadge.tsx",
    "src/Api/Auth/PermissionInheritanceService.cs",
    "src/pages/Settings/Workspace/Security.tsx"
  ],
  
  "notes": "This is likely a significant sub-feature of RBAC that should be documented in the RBAC feature docs. May warrant its own section in the capabilities list."
